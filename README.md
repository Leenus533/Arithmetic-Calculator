Arithmetic Calculator using Java Swing

Introduction:
The Arithmetic Calculator is a simple calculater app developed using Java's Swing framework. It provides the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a user-friendly interface and allows users to perform calculations easily and view the results instantly.

Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports the four primary arithmetic operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division


Implementation:
Java Swing Framework: The application utilizes Java's Swing framework to create the graphical user interface. This framework provides a rich set of widgets and controls, making it easier to develop desktop applications.

Event Handling: The calculator responds to user actions using Java's event handling mechanisms. Each button press triggers a specific event, which the program then processes to perform the desired operation.

Arithmetic Logic: The core arithmetic operations are implemented using basic mathematical operations provided by the Java language. The results are then displayed on the screen for the user.
